# Hoooked

Hoooked is a social media platform where users can request friends watch or read various forms of media.   

# Inspiration

You just watched a mind blowing movie, or played a great video game, or read a great book.   You want to share that experience with someone else.   But perhaps it is an unpopular movie, an old video game, or the issue is simply that nobody in your circle of friends has yet taken the time to experience it themselves?

[You're full of excitement, theories, and you want to share them but there's nobody to share them with....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSAALRWehGA)

Solution, you Hoook'm.   

On Hoooked you can recommend all sorts of media to friends and they can score points and badges (in development) for following your recommendations, and you as well for following their recommendations.
